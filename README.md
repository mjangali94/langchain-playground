# LangChain Practice

This repository contains my hands-on practice with **LangChain**, including agents, tools, RAG pipelines, embeddings, vector databases, and AI-driven workflows.

## 🚀 What I’m Learning
- Building agents with memory
- Using tools with ChatGPT / OpenAI / Anthropic models
- Creating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines
- Document loading and chunking
- Working with embeddings and vector stores (FAISS, Chroma)
- Streaming responses
- Creating multi-step AI workflows
- Building small automation agents and chatbots


## 🧠 Goals
- Understand modern LLM frameworks
- Build practical AI automations
- Learn agent/tool architectures
- Gain experience with embeddings & vector DBs
- Prepare for future AI-based backend work

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python 3.10+
- LangChain
- FAISS / Chroma
- OpenAI / Anthropic APIs
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🌱 Future Additions
- Streamlit chatbot UI
- Multi-agent workflows
- File-based personal assistant
- Local LLM integration (Ollama)
- Deployment examples
